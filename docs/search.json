    "text": "Abstract\nRoughly one‑third of U.S. primary care visits end with a specialist referral, yet little is known about how these referral links are first established. Focusing on primary care physicians (PCPs) who enter or relocate to a new market, we study the determinants of initial PCP–specialist networks using the universe of 2009–2018 Medicare fee‑for‑service claims, focusing on referrals for planned and elective orthopedic surgeries. A reduced‑form network‑formation model with two‑sided fixed effects shows that sharing a common physician practice is overwhelmingly the most dominant factor in forming initial referral links, followed by gender homophily and geographic proximity. When re-interpreting results in terms of quality of care, distance between PCPs and specialists emerges as a more important factor, with results suggesting that preference for closer specialists might actually improve quality of care conditional on existing organizational and demographic homophily. An extension into the dynamics of referral links shows that demographic concordance measures dissipate over time, while the effects of organizational preference and distance attenuate but remain significant factors."

    "text": "Abstract\nWe use a rigorous three-stage many-analysts design to assess how different researcher decisions—specifically data cleaning, research design, and the interpretation of a policy question—affect the variation in estimated treatment effects. A total of 146 research teams each completed the same causal inference task three times each: first with few constraints, then using a shared research design, and finally with pre-cleaned data in addition to a specified design. We find that even when analyzing the same data, teams reach different conclusions. In the first stage, the interquartile range (IQR) of the reported policy effect was 3.1 percentage points, with substantial outliers. Surprisingly, the second stage, which restricted research design choices, exhibited slightly higher IQR (4.0 percentage points), largely attributable to imperfect adherence to the prescribed protocol. By contrast, the final stage, featuring standardized data cleaning, narrowed variation in estimated effects, achieving an IQR of 2.4 percentage points. Reported sample sizes also displayed significant convergence under more restrictive conditions, with the IQR dropping from 295,187 in the first stage to 29,144 in the second, and effectively zero by the third. Our findings underscore the critical importance of data cleaning in shaping applied microeconomic results and highlight avenues for future replication efforts."

    "text": "Abstract\nHospitals are critical inputs into patient health and, increasingly, local economies. And yet policy-makers continue to struggle with the increasing rate of hospital closures, particularly in rural ares. Created by the Balanced Budget Act in 1997, Critical Access Hospital (CAH) designation was designed to offer financial assistance to hospitals in financial distress, focusing on hospitals in rural areas. We explore whether CAH designation improves a hospital’s financial standing, and ultimately its effects on hospital closures and mergers."

    "text": "Abstract\nSpecialty hospitals tend to negotiate higher commercial insurance payments, even for relatively routine procedures with comparable clinical quality across hospital types. How specialty hospitals can maintain such a price premium remains an open question. In this paper, we examine a potential (horizontal) differentiation effect in which patients perceive specialty hospitals as sufficiently distinct from other hospitals, so that specialty hospitals effectively compete in a separate market from general acute care hospitals. We estimate this effect in the context of routine pediatric procedures offered by both specialty children’s hospitals as well as general acute care hospitals, and we find strong empirical evidence of a differentiation effect in which specialty children’s hospitals appear largely immune to competitive forces from non-children’s hospitals."

    "text": "Abstract\nPublic pay-for-performance (P4P) programs tie hospital payments to predetermined sets of quality measures and are intended to encourage or discourage certain outcomes. To the extent that financial penalties from these programs induce some response by hospitals, such penalties may translate into higher negotiated payments from commercial insurance payers. In this paper, we employ data on commercial insurance payments from a large, multi-payer database to study the extent to which penalties levied under the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP) and the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (HVBP) program, two major P4P components of the Affordable Care Act, caused changes in private hospital payments. We find that the bulk of any penalties resulting from HRRP and HVBP are borne by private insurance patients in the form of higher private insurance payments. Specifically, we show that HRRP and HVBP financial penalties led to increases in private payments of 1.9 percent, with effects concentrated among circulatory system procedures. These penalties were also associated with a 3.1 percent reduction in Medicare discharges. Our estimates are larger for hospitals with higher shares of privately insured patients, which suggests the importance of hospital bargaining power in facilitating higher commercial insurance payments."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe organizational structure of U.S. health care markets has changed dramatically in recent years, with nearly half of physicians now employed by hospitals. This trend toward increasing vertical alignment between physicians and hospitals may alter physician behavior relative to physicians remaining in independent or group practices. We examine the effects of such vertical alignment using an instrumental variable strategy and a clinical context facilitating well-defined episodes of care in order to capture effects of integration beyond a single hospital or physician visit. When physicians treat patients at hospitals in which they are integrated, we find increases in total episode spending of around 5%, primarily driven by the administrative substitution of office visits with outpatient visits and associated site-of-care payment differentials. We also estimate a large and statistically significant reduction in overall service counts and claims within an episode, with some evidence of an increase in the intensity of services provided. Ultimately, acquiring hospitals capture more revenue following a physician practice acquisition; yet, the smaller overall bundle of care generates no net savings to Medicare due partly to higher intensity of services as well as site-based payment rules favorable to hospitals."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Numerous studies show that employer plans pay providers significantly more than Medicare, but less is known about prices in nongroup plans, where narrow networks and low-cost insurers are more prevalent. We estimate prices for three market segments—on-marketplace nongroup, off-marketplace nongroup, and small group—and for three types of services—inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, and professional—relative to a Medicare benchmark. We use 2021 claims data covering virtually all enrollment in Affordable Care Act risk-adjusted plans. In aggregate, marketplace prices are 152% of Medicare prices, while the prices paid in small employer plans are 179% of Medicare. Comparing across market segments, relative to small group, marketplace professional prices are 6.9% lower, inpatient prices are 13.3% lower, and outpatient prices are 26.3% lower. Off-marketplace prices fall between marketplace and small group prices. The finding that nongroup prices are significantly lower than prices paid by employer plans – more so than indicated by prior research – is important for understanding federal subsidies and affordability for nongroup coverage and evaluating policies such as a nongroup public option with prices capped at a percentage of Medicare."

    "text": "Purpose: Medicare’s differential payments for services delivered in physician offices versus hospital outpatient settings incentivize hospital-physician integration (ie, vertical integration) across many specialties, but evidence for oncologists is mixed. We examined the association of Medicare site-based payment policy and physician practice characteristics, including service volume and diversity, with vertical integration among oncologists in 2013-2019.\nMethods: Using the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data and Medicare Data on Provider Practice and Specialty in 2013-2019, we extracted nonintegrated medical/hematologic oncologists (hereafter oncologists) in 2013 and followed them through 2019. We quantified the incentives from Medicare site-based payment policy using the hospital-office ratio-total Medicare payments if all services were delivered in the hospital outpatient department (HOPD) versus physician office. Vertical integration was defined as billing &gt;10% of services to HOPD in a year. Multivariable linear probability regressions estimated the association between hospital-office ratio and vertical integration in 2014-2019 with and without accounting for provider characteristics.\nResults: In 2013, the average hospital-office ratio was 1.63, which increased to 1.99 in 2018. A 25th-to-75th percentile increase in the hospital-office ratio was negatively associated with integration (-1.01 percentage points [ppts], 95% CI = -1.45 to -0.57, p &lt; .001) not accounting for physician practice characteristics; this association was attenuated (-0.30 ppts, 95% CI = -0.67 to 0.07, p = .11) after adjusting for these characteristics. Higher baseline (ie, 2013) service volume (Quartile4 v Quartile1 = -3.00 ppts, 95% CI = -4.42 to -1.59, p &lt; .001), more diverse services (Quartile4 v Quartile1 = -3.55 ppts, 95% CI = -4.97 to -2.13, p &lt; .001), and urban location (-5.23 ppts, 95% CI = -6.89 to -3.57, p &lt; .001) were more strongly associated with vertical integration.\nConclusion: Compared to Medicare site-based payment policy, oncologists’ practice characteristics emerged as more potent factors for integration and should be considered to ensure the intended impacts of site-based payment reform. Our finding raises questions about the effectiveness of ongoing movements toward site-neutral payment for drug administration services to deter vertical integration in oncology."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn some markets such as real estate, used automobiles, and insurance, consumers face significant cognitive challenges that may require the assistance of an agent or intermediary. The influence of agents on consumer decisions, and the firm’s influence on the behaviors of its agents, have important implications for the efficiency of these markets. In this paper, we study the welfare effects of decision assistance and firm steering in health insurance.\nWe use consumer-level enrollment data from the California Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchange, with 8.3 million household-year observations from 2014 to 2019. The data include a variety of household characteristics, plan choices and plan characteristics, and information on the type of decision assistance used by the enrollee (if any). Using these data, we can precisely identify each household’s choice set, the premium paid for each plan in the choice set, and any premium and cost sharing subsidies for which the household is eligible.\nOur initial analysis exploits the presence of “dominated plans” in the ACA exchanges, where we find that new enrollees using some form of decision assistance (agents or navigators) are approximately 28% less likely to make a dominated choice. We then examine the causal effect of decision assistance on health insurance choice. Here, we find that decision assistance has a statistically significant and economically meaningful effect on plan choice, with enrollees 50% more likely to select a silver plan when using some form of decision assistance and 20% less likely to be uninsured.\nWe then turn to a structural analysis of insurer steering, commissions, and premiums. Preliminary results suggest that firms have considerable ability to steer consumers’ decisions using agent commissions. For small firms, a $1 increase in the plan commission has the same effect as a $2 decrease in the plan premium on the probability of the plan being chosen. The effect is more pronounced for larger insurers, where a $1 increase in the plan commission is equivalent to a $3.50 decrease in the plan premium.\nOur results provide strong evidence that decision assistance has a significant and economically meaningful effect on health insurance plan choice. Decision assistance in general tends to improve plan choices, increasing the probability that enrollees select a silver plan and decreasing the probability of making a dominated choice. Gains to social welfare are potentially offset by insurer steering, which introduces the potential for alternative agent compensation schemes to improve welfare in this market."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nDue to pervasive information problems and the multifaceted nature of hospital quality, selecting a hospital for an elective inpatient stay is a complicated and difficult decision. Online reviews provide an easily accessible and salient source of hospital quality information, thereby potentially affecting hospital choice and related outcomes such as hospital prices. Using the universe of hospital Yelp reviews and inpatient claims data for elective procedures in Florida from 2012 through 2017, we exploit exogenous variation in online hospital ratings over time to identify the effect of online reviews on hospital choice. We find that among admissions for elective, inpatient procedures, patients are willing to travel between 5 and 30 percent further to receive care from a hospital with a higher Yelp rating, relative to other hospitals in the market. We also find evidence that higher ratings translate into higher commercial payments from insurers, albeit with relatively modest magnitudes. Our results indicate that novel, accessible sources of quality information have the potential to affect health care decisions, with potential downstream effects on health care prices."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn many areas of care, primary care physicians (PCPs) greatly influence a patient’s choice of specialist, but how well do PCPs learn about specialist quality, if at all? In this paper, we study PCP referrals to specialists, using the population of orthopedic procedures for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries from 2008 through 2018. We document substantial heterogeneity in specialist quality and cost within geographic markets, and we present design-based evidence that PCPs adjust their referrals specifically based on the outcomes of their own patients. We then employ a structural learning model to study learning and efficiency in the market for physician referrals. In the model, PCPs update their beliefs about specialist quality based on the outcomes of their referred patients. The model also accounts for habit persistence and capacity constraints, which are important limitations for counterfactual reallocations under improved learning. We find that PCPs respond modestly to the outcomes of their referred patients; however, PCPs remain slow to learn about quality difference among specialists in their market, instead relying more on prior relationships in governing referrals. This suggests there is scope to improve market efficiency if PCPs can learn more quickly and better tailor referral decisions on specialist quality."
