My name is Ian McCarthy, and I’m an Associate Professor of Economics at Emory University and a Research Associate with the National Bureau of Economic Research. I study issues related to health care pricing, equity, and efficiency. I also teach health economics classes at the undergraduate and graduate levels at Emory.\nPrior to joining Emory, I was a senior consultant and director in the economic consulting practice of FTI Consulting in Dallas, TX. I was also an associate investigator and the director of health economics for the Baylor Health Care System in Dallas, TX."

    "text": "Since joining Emory University in 2014, I’ve had the opportunity to teach several health economics courses, including a freshman seminar in health policy, an upper-level elective on supply-side health economics, a capstone course on research methods in health economics and policy, and a PhD course on supply-side health economics. Over time, I’ve migrated most of my teaching material to stand-alone websites for each class, each with its own GitHub repository. Links and brief descriptions for these classes are available below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                Current Issues in U.S. Health Care \n                \n            \n            \n                ECON 190 | \n                Emory University\n                \n            \n            This is a Freshman Seminar focusing on current issues in U.S. health care. The class is organized around weekly podcasts and videos. This content helps to facilitate more detailed discussion throughout each class. I supplement this material with questions from students each week. I ask students to submit their questions in the first half of the week, and we use these questions to further advance our weekly discussions.\n\n            \n                \n                \n                 Spring 2022\n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                Economics of Health Care Markets \n                \n            \n            \n                ECON 372 | \n                Emory University\n                \n            \n            This is an elective economics course focusing on “supply side” health economics. The course examines the industrial organization of health care markets in the U.S., including underlying theory, empirical findings, and related health care policy. We study insurance markets, informational asymmetries between physicians and patients, as well as issues of hospital pricing and payments.\n\n            \n                \n                \n                 Fall 2024\n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                Research in Health Economics \n                \n            \n            \n                ECON/HLTH 470 | \n                Emory University\n                \n            \n            This is the capstone course for the joint major in Economics and Human Health. The course effectively combines health economics and human health content with data science. Using real-world data, we explore four research questions throughout the semester, each exemplifying a different research design.\n\n            \n                \n                \n                 Spring 2024\n                \n                \n                \n                 Spring 2025\n                \n                \n            \n        \n    \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                \n                Health Economics II \n                \n            \n            \n                ECON 771 | \n                Emory University\n                \n            \n            This is a PhD course in supply side health economics.

    "text": "Abstract\nThe organizational structure of U.S. health care markets has changed dramatically in recent years, with nearly half of physicians now employed by hospitals. This trend toward increasing vertical alignment between physicians and hospitals may alter physician behavior relative to physicians remaining in independent or group practices. We examine the effects of such vertical alignment using an instrumental variable strategy and a clinical context facilitating well-defined episodes of care in order to capture effects of integration beyond a single hospital or physician visit. When physicians treat patients at hospitals in which they are integrated, we find increases in total episode spending of around 5%, primarily driven by the administrative substitution of office visits with outpatient visits and associated site-of-care payment differentials. We also estimate a large and statistically significant reduction in overall service counts and claims within an episode, with some evidence of an increase in the intensity of services provided. Ultimately, acquiring hospitals capture more revenue following a physician practice acquisition; yet, the smaller overall bundle of care generates no net savings to Medicare due partly to higher intensity of services as well as site-based payment rules favorable to hospitals."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn many areas of care, primary care physicians (PCPs) greatly influence a patient’s choice of specialist, but how well do PCPs learn about specialist quality, if at all? In this paper, we study PCP referrals to specialists, using the population of orthopedic procedures for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries from 2008 through 2018. We document substantial heterogeneity in specialist quality and cost within geographic markets, and we present design-based evidence that PCPs adjust their referrals specifically based on the outcomes of their own patients. We then employ a structural learning model to study learning and efficiency in the market for physician referrals. In the model, PCPs update their beliefs about specialist quality based on the outcomes of their referred patients. The model also accounts for habit persistence and capacity constraints, which are important limitations for counterfactual reallocations under improved learning. We find that PCPs respond modestly to the outcomes of their referred patients; however, PCPs remain slow to learn about quality difference among specialists in their market, instead relying more on prior relationships in governing referrals. This suggests there is scope to improve market efficiency if PCPs can learn more quickly and better tailor referral decisions on specialist quality."

    "text": "Abstract\nDue to pervasive information problems and the multifaceted nature of hospital quality, selecting a hospital for an elective inpatient stay is a complicated and difficult decision. Online reviews provide an easily accessible and salient source of hospital quality information, thereby potentially affecting hospital choice and related outcomes such as hospital prices. Using the universe of hospital Yelp reviews and inpatient claims data for elective procedures in Florida from 2012 through 2017, we exploit exogenous variation in online hospital ratings over time to identify the effect of online reviews on hospital choice. We find that among admissions for elective, inpatient procedures, patients are willing to travel between 5 and 30 percent further to receive care from a hospital with a higher Yelp rating, relative to other hospitals in the market. We also find evidence that higher ratings translate into higher commercial payments from insurers, albeit with relatively modest magnitudes. Our results indicate that novel, accessible sources of quality information have the potential to affect health care decisions, with potential downstream effects on health care prices."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn some markets such as real estate, used automobiles, and insurance, consumers face significant cognitive challenges that may require the assistance of an agent or intermediary. The influence of agents on consumer decisions, and the firm’s influence on the behaviors of its agents, have important implications for the efficiency of these markets. In this paper, we study the welfare effects of decision assistance and firm steering in health insurance.\nWe use consumer-level enrollment data from the California Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchange, with 8.3 million household-year observations from 2014 to 2019. The data include a variety of household characteristics, plan choices and plan characteristics, and information on the type of decision assistance used by the enrollee (if any). Using these data, we can precisely identify each household’s choice set, the premium paid for each plan in the choice set, and any premium and cost sharing subsidies for which the household is eligible.\nOur initial analysis exploits the presence of “dominated plans” in the ACA exchanges, where we find that new enrollees using some form of decision assistance (agents or navigators) are approximately 28% less likely to make a dominated choice. We then examine the causal effect of decision assistance on health insurance choice. Here, we find that decision assistance has a statistically significant and economically meaningful effect on plan choice, with enrollees 50% more likely to select a silver plan when using some form of decision assistance and 20% less likely to be uninsured.\nWe then turn to a structural analysis of insurer steering, commissions, and premiums. Preliminary results suggest that firms have considerable ability to steer consumers’ decisions using agent commissions. For small firms, a $1 increase in the plan commission has the same effect as a $2 decrease in the plan premium on the probability of the plan being chosen. The effect is more pronounced for larger insurers, where a $1 increase in the plan commission is equivalent to a $3.50 decrease in the plan premium.\nOur results provide strong evidence that decision assistance has a significant and economically meaningful effect on health insurance plan choice. Decision assistance in general tends to improve plan choices, increasing the probability that enrollees select a silver plan and decreasing the probability of making a dominated choice. Gains to social welfare are potentially offset by insurer steering, which introduces the potential for alternative agent compensation schemes to improve welfare in this market."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Numerous studies show that employer plans pay providers significantly more than Medicare, but less is known about prices in nongroup plans, where narrow networks and low-cost insurers are more prevalent. We estimate prices for three market segments—on-marketplace nongroup, off-marketplace nongroup, and small group—and for three types of services—inpatient hospital, outpatient hospital, and professional—relative to a Medicare benchmark. We use 2021 claims data covering virtually all enrollment in Affordable Care Act risk-adjusted plans. In aggregate, marketplace prices are 152% of Medicare prices, while the prices paid in small employer plans are 179% of Medicare. Comparing across market segments, relative to small group, marketplace professional prices are 6.9% lower, inpatient prices are 13.3% lower, and outpatient prices are 26.3% lower. Off-marketplace prices fall between marketplace and small group prices. The finding that nongroup prices are significantly lower than prices paid by employer plans – more so than indicated by prior research – is important for understanding federal subsidies and affordability for nongroup coverage and evaluating policies such as a nongroup public option with prices capped at a percentage of Medicare."

This trend toward increasing vertical alignment between physicians and hospitals may alter physician behavior relative to physicians remaining in independent or group practices. We examine the effects of such vertical alignment using an instrumental variable strategy and a clinical context facilitating well-defined episodes of care in order to capture effects of integration beyond a single hospital or physician visit. When physicians treat patients at hospitals in which they are integrated, we find increases in total episode spending of around 5%, primarily driven by the administrative substitution of office visits with outpatient visits and associated site-of-care payment differentials. We also estimate a large and statistically significant reduction in overall service counts and claims within an episode, with some evidence of an increase in the intensity of services provided. Ultimately, acquiring hospitals capture more revenue following a physician practice acquisition; yet, the smaller overall bundle of care generates no net savings to Medicare due partly to higher intensity of services as well as site-based payment rules favorable to hospitals."
