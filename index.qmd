        I'm a health economist studying how information problems shape the way health care is priced, delivered, and financed. My work combines large administrative datasets, causal inference methods, and economic theory to examine hospital pricing, insurance design, health care quality, and access. I currently serve as Associate Editor at the American Journal of Health Economics and the Southern Economic Journal, and I was a Visiting Scholar at the Congressional Budget Office from 2021 to 2023. Before academia, I spent several years in economic consulting and health system administration, which informs how I approach these questions. I also teach health economics and empirical methods at Emory, with all course materials freely available online.
