I’ve taken on a few service projects in recent years, in addition to the usual professional service like referee reports, conference organization, etc. Brief descriptions, and links to other information if available, are below:

# [Professionalism Workshop](https://phdworkshop.classes.ianmccarthyecon.com/)

This is a workshop for 2nd-5th year Economics PhD students. We cover lots of “unwritten” things that most PhD students should know, including best practices for workflow, conferences, presentations, and ultimately the job market.

# Mentorship

As a first-generation college student, I’m well aware of how challenging it can be to navigate into/around academia for those of use not already connected to that space. So I try to volunteer my time as a mentor as generously as possible. A few of my regular mentorship efforts are listed below:

- ASHEcon annual mentorship sessions, 2018-2022
- Research in Color, 2019-2020 and 2020-2021
- Association for Mentoring and Inclusion in Economics, 2022-2024
