Since joining Emory University in 2014, I’ve had the opportunity to teach several health economics courses, including a freshman seminar in health policy, an upper-level elective on supply-side health economics, a capstone course on research methods in health economics and policy, and a PhD course on supply-side health economics. Over time, I’ve migrated most of my teaching material to stand-alone websites for each class, each with its own GitHub repository. Links and brief descriptions for these classes are available below.
